The const char *arg and subsequent ellipses can be thought of as  arg0,
       arg1, ..., argn.  Together they describe a list of one or more pointers
       to  null-terminated  strings that represent the argument list available
       to the executed program.  The first  argument,  by  convention,  should
       point  to  the  filename  associated with the file being executed.  The
       list of arguments must be terminated by  a  null  pointer,  and,  since
       these are variadic functions, this pointer must be cast (char *) NULL.

       By  contrast  with the 'l' functions, the 'v' functions (below) specify
       the command-line arguments of the executed program as a vector.

   v - execv(), execvp(), execvpe()
       The char *const argv[] argument is an array of pointers to  null-termi‐
       nated  strings  that  represent  the argument list available to the new
       program.  The first argument, by convention, should point to the  file‐
       name  associated  with  the file being executed.  The array of pointers
       must be terminated by a null pointer.
